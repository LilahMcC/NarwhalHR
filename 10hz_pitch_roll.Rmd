Goal: Make a single dataframe with columns: DateTime, depth, pitch, roll at 10Hz frequency (10 rows per second)  
Steps:   
1. Downsample acceleration from 100 to 10 Hz  
1. Upsample depth from 1 to 10 Hz  
1. Calculate pitch and roll from acceleration values. 

Downsample acceleration:   
- Pipe acceleration  
- Use slice function (take every 10th point)   
- Pipe to mutate and call approx()  


Upsample depth:  
- Use approx ()  
- Parameters: x = DateTime (vector), y = depth (vector), xout = DateTime values that you want depth values for   (vector), $y.    

Calculate pitch and roll and mutate into dataframe   
- See existing .Rmd files.
