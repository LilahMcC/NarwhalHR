spec.pgram: Explaining the parameters:  
-  x (dateframe that contains a time column, and another column with a variable that changes over time)  
- spans ( )

```{r}
asgeir_10hz_pitch <- readRDS("Asgeir_10hz.rds") %>% #Create df with just t and pitch
  transmute(t = DateTime, 
            pitch = pitch) #should pitch be |pitch|?

spec <- spec.pgram(asgeir_10hz_pitch, 
                   spans = 11, #time window is 3 seconds on either side maybe?
                   )

spec_df <- transmute(asgeir_10hz_pitch, 
                     t = t, 
                     freq = spec[["freq"]], 
                     power = spec[["spec"]])
